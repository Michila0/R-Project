Hi all,
Iâ€™m Janeth. Currently, I am a third-year undergraduate at IIT. For one year I work at WSO2 as a software engineering intern. I started to love programming after I joined IIT. I am a person who likes to learn and try out new things. As a result, me and few friends started a startup company. We undertake various kinds of projects. The main objective is to improve our skills and have experiance in various technologies. We also have a YouTube channel to share our technical knowledge with others. I am also a contributor to SEF.

In my free time, I travel with my friends, do camping in various places in Sri Lanka. I love to capture all those memories as a photograph.
