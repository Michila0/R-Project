Hi all,
Iâ€™m Michila. Currently, I am a Second-year undergraduate at IIT. I started to love programming after I joined IIT.  I am also a contributor to SEF.I am a person who likes to learn and try out new things. As a result, me and few friends started a startup company. We undertake various kinds of projects. The main objective is to improve our skills and have experiance in various technologies.

In my free time, I travel with my friends, do camping in various places in Sri Lanka.
